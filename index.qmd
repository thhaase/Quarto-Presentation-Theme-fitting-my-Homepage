## Example slide
### This is a subtitle

Here we have some text that may run over several lines of the slide frame,
depending on how long it is.

- first item 
    - A sub item

Next, we'll brief review some theme-specific components.

- Note that _all_ of the standard Reveal.js
[features](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/)
can be used with this theme, even if we don't highlight them here.

## Additional theme classes
Special classes for emphasis
- `.alert` class for default emphasis, e.g. [important note]{.alert}.
- `.fg` class for custom colour, e.g. [important note]{.fg style="--col: #e64173"}.
- `.bg` class for custom background, e.g. [important note]{.bg style="--col: #e64173"}.

Cross-references
